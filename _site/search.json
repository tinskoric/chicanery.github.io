    "text": "Chicanery introduces a series of new mechanics, to support player interaction, but chief among them is a unique implementation of voice-chat for negotiations. Chicanery uses private voice-chat rooms for negotiations between players, rather than messaging (the latter is typical for online diplomacy implementations), although messaging is available for players without microphones within the room. The rooms prevent players from being able to juggle multiple negotiations simultaneously, and instead force them to pick who they want to focus their energies on in the limited time they have per phase. Additionally, while the rooms are ‚Äúprivate‚Äù from other players, it is not unfair to assume that if another player is not in your room talking with you, it‚Äôs because they are talking to someone else. Moreover, there are ways for other players to gather more information on these ‚Äúprivate‚Äù rooms and attempt to snoop.\nChicanery further introduces a series of mechanics that can be broadly categorized as relating to player unit-management, economy, and research in game. Click any of the below layers to expand for an explain-er on the eponymous group of mechanics!\nThis note is short as the combat mechanics of units remain the same‚Äîenjoy your attacks, holds, supports, and convoy orders‚Äîrather, units are slightly altered in how they recover during retreat phases. After each movement phase, units must be replenished before being usable in combat for the next phase. The below table details the scenarios or units in a given movement phase, and their subsequent replenishment need in the following retreat phase:\n\nUnit Replenishment Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\nReplenishment Need\n\n\n\n\nUnit did not engage in combat with an enemy1 unit (either defensive or offensive!) in the movement phase.\nNo need.\n\n\nUnit engaged in defensive combat and was successful.\nBase of 20% replenishment need.\n\n\nUnit engaged in defensive combat and failed (must retreat/burn in retreat phase).\nIf retreated: base 70% replenishment need. If burned: no need.\n\n\nUnit engaged in offensive combat and was successful.\nNo need2.\n\n\nUnit engaged in offensive combat and failed (didn‚Äôt take territory).\nBase of 50% replenishment need.\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, losing a battle over a tile (province) where you are defending is very costly, particularly at the start. If a unit is not replenished, it will be unusable for combat actions, including for support orders. An un-replenished unit will not be able to take any orders‚Äîno attacks, holds, or supports‚Äîexcept convoys that would bring it to friendly territory3(cannot be used in convoys for attacking). An un-replenished unit will not hold if attacked, no matter if it is supported or not, and rather will immediately retreat4. Replenishment costs income and the costs can be altered by research, which segues us nicely into the next sections.\n\n\nIn traditional (we‚Äôre not talking about esoteric variants right now) Diplomacy, the player ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù is extremely straightforward. There are a number of supply centers (centers hereafter) on the board based in cities. The number of centers you have defines how many units (referring to armies/fleets) you may build. In Chicanery, this relationship is abstracted.\nIn Chicanery, centers generate income (denoted, \\(I\\), in included formulae) and action points (denoted AP hereafter) which serve dual functions. Income is used to purchase (and replenish, in the case of units) things like units, buildings, and ‚Äúaccoutrements‚Äù5 (discussed in the research subsection). AP are used to order units and accoutrements. Income and AP are earned and accrued differently across turns and phases, illustrating the subtle difference in their functions. See the below sections for details:\n\nIncomeAction Points (AP)\n\n\nIncome is a linear function of the number of centers controlled between turns, earned at the start of the Spring phase (the start of a new turn), and available to be spent on various uses across all phases. Income is calculated purely by multiplying a scalar by the number of centers you possess (and adding bonuses from research).\n\nIncome by Phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSpring (\\(\\pm\\))\nIncome from centers held after the previous Fall phase is earned and added to the rolling total. Income can be spent on research (like replenishment cost buffs!) and research items.\n\n\nSummer (\\(-\\))\nIncome is spent on replenishing units.\n\n\nFall (\\(-\\))\nIncome can be spent on research items.\n\n\nWinter (\\(-\\))\nIncome is spent on replenishing units.\n\n\nBuild (\\(-\\))\nIncome is spent on purchasing new units and research items.\n\n\n\nLastly, income can be saved between phases and turns. You will not lose the income you do not spend, it will roll over from one turn to the next. You can send other players a portion (or all) of your income.\n\n\nAP are a decreasing function of the number of centers controlled between phases, earned at the start of the Spring and Fall phases, and available to be spent for use across all phases. AP is calculated by adding a fixed base number for a given number of centers and an exponentially decreasing function of your total center-count. As your state grows, the relative AP that you get from each center is less and less, constraining you opportunities for orders in each turn.\n\nAction Points (AP) by Phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSpring (\\(\\pm\\))\nAP from centers held after the previous Fall phase is earned. AP can be spent on issuing orders (attack, hold, support, convoy) to units.\n\n\nSummer (\\(-\\))\nAP is spent on issuing retreat orders to units.\n\n\nFall (\\(\\pm\\))\nAP from centers held after the Spring phase is earned. AP can be spent on issuing orders to units.\n\n\nWinter (\\(-\\))\nAP is spent on issuing retreat orders to units.\n\n\nBuild (\\(-\\))\nAP is spent on placing new units and researched buildings‚Äîports, supply hubs, and forts.\n\n\n\nIf you gain/lose centers between the Spring and Fall phases, you will see the AP you earn in the latter phase altered, even if your opponent does not control that center for the whole turn.\n\nE.g., if you control a center at the outset of Spring year-something and someone else takes it in that turn, then in Fall year-something, your earned AP in the latter turn will not include AP that would‚Äôve been earned from that center. Conversely, if you were the other player who gained it, your AP in the latter turn will include the income from that center.\n\nLastly, AP can only be saved between phases. You WILL lose the AP you do not spend between turns, it will not roll over from one year to the next. You cannot send other players your AP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least is research. This mechanic integrates with the unit and economy changes, but also includes some fun gameplay elements. First there are plain buffs. These buffs center around reductions to the income cost of replenishment, some income bonuses for taking centers, and increases to the amount of AP earned for larger players. All items‚Äîbuildings, accoutrements‚Äîmust first be researched for a fixed cost of income. After being researched, individual buildings must be bought with income and placed with AP each time, and individual accoutrements must be bought with income (no AP needed for their use!). Accoutrements are tools for subterfuge and deceit. In the case of buffs, research functionally just means paying more for a better effect as the research for buffs is reset each turn. For buildings, research is a one-time cost to be able to build something‚Äîthe research is not reset. For accoutrements, research is a one-time cost‚Äîthe research is not reset‚Äîbut accoutrements are one-time use, and must be bought for each use. Below are sections detailing research across the three defined groups:\n\nBuildingsBuffsAccoutrements\n\n\nThere are only three buildings, they cost income to research (once), and then income purchase and AP to place, and they can only be placed during the build phase. Buildings act to make small adjustments to traditional Diplomacy mechanics. Although these buildings are not temporary, there is a limit to the number of buildings you can place according to the total number of provinces you command, and they can be destroyed or lost. If you exceed your limit, then you must delete buildings during the Build phase until you are within your limit.\n\nResearch Information: Buildings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nFort\nBuilding a fort in a tile (province) simply adds a permanent +1 to defense in that tile. Think of it as having a second army that can take no orders but automatically follows a support-defend order on whatever friendly unit is occupying the tile. Unlike the other two buildings, forts cost replenishment‚Äîequal to the costs of a typical unit. If a defense for a tile is lost and an enemy takes control, the opposing player who has assumed control of the province must pay to replenish the fort. Unlike units, which will simply retreat if left un-replenished, if a fort is left un-replenished for two entire movement phases (Spring and Fall or Fall and Spring) after first needing replenishment, it will be destroyed6. Forts do not earn income or AP, and they do not contribute to your total number of centers. Ports require replenishment (as detailed) and are not destroyed upon the loss of a tile‚Äîso long as they are replenished.\n\n\nPort\nBuilding a port in a tile (province) allows one army and one fleet (or two fleets and no army) to simultaneously occupy the same tile, by effectively creating a sub-tile for the fleet. Since the actual tile continues to hold only a single unit this still counts only as a +1 defense rather than a +2. If the main tile is lost, both units must retreat to their respective adjacent options. Each unit can still operate independently from the province (e.g., they can attack or support different things, including each other7). Ports do not earn income or AP, and they do not contribute to your total number of centers. Ports do not require replenishment and are not destroyed upon the loss of a tile‚Äîports are only destroyed if you have to destroy them to stay within your building limit.\n\n\nSupply Hub\nIn classic Diplomacy, you can only build units in your starting centers‚Ä¶ until you build a supply hub! Supply hubs allow you to build units in whichever tile (province) a supply hub is present in. Supply hubs do not earn income or AP, and they do not contribute to your total number of centers. Supply centers do not require replenishment, but are immediately destroyed upon the loss of the tile8.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffs include reductions to the income cost of replenishment, some income bonuses for taking centers, and increases to the amount of AP earned for larger players. Buffs are TEMPORARY, and only last the duration of each turn, but activate automatically after research‚Äîwithin the same phase. These reductions are earned via research paths and stack. For some examples:\nReduction to Cost of Replenishment:\n\nResearching three buffs down this route will reduce all costs by 30%‚Äîat first only by 5%, then by 10% for the next time, and 15% after than. It is impossible to entirely eliminate all costs of replenishment, but these reductions result in defensive and offensive losses costing only 40% and 20% respectively, and all other cases costing nothing.\n\nBonuses for Taking Centers:\n\nPillaging! Researching buffs down this route will give an income reward for taking centers that is increased per level of research down the route and stacks with previous levels. Researching three buffs down the route will give a bonus of +6% of total income earned from the start of a turn.\n\nE.g., if you earned 100 income at the start of Spring year-something, and you purchased three buffs down this route, then when you capture any center in the same phase (Spring year-something) or the next phase (Fall year-something), you with earn 6 income immediately‚Äîin the same phase‚Äîfor the capture of that center.\n\n\nIncreases to AP Earned:\n\nMakes the exponential decrease in AP earned per center flatter.\n\n\n\nThese are the fun tools. Accoutrements must be researched (once) using income, and then purchased for each use using income. Unlike buildings, these do not cost AP, and unlike buffs, they are not temporary to only the turn they were purchased in, but rather are one-time use upon purchase and remain available for use across phases and turns until they are used. Accoutrements range from snooping- to ‚Äúcounter-snooping‚Äù-related niceties. For example:\nWar Plans:\n\nResearching down this path and purchasing the associated accoutrement allows you to get hints on one specified order (1 move can still be a notable informational advantage) in a tile (province) by another player at the time the accoutrement is used9. The higher the level of research, the more accurate the hint‚Äîat lower levels, dummy moves will be by a probability chance, and/or the type of move may be reported, but not the destination.\n\nFalse Flags:\n\nResearching down this path and purchasing the associated accoutrement allows you to fake hints served by the ‚ÄúWar Plans‚Äù accoutremont for a specified tile, providing them as dummy moves. While War Plans requires selecting a tile, False Flags work across all tiles as a passive effect to counter War Plans for the phase in which the former is activated10. This muddles the information war between players.\n\nGovernment Insiders:\n\nResearching down this path and purchasing the associated accoutrement allows you to get estimates of other players incomes and AP.\n\nHi-Fi Audio:\n\nResearching down this path allows you to see more details about voice-chat rooms such as:\n\nThe total number of rooms are a given time;\nThe players currently in any call.\n\nNo level of research will show exactly which player is in which call, but by knowing the details above and using some deduction it should be possible to decipher who is with who in what calls."

The higher the level of research, the more accurate the hint‚Äîat lower levels, dummy moves will be by a probability chance, and/or the type of move may be reported, but not the destination.\n\nFalse Flags:\n\nResearching down this path and purchasing the associated accoutrement allows you to fake hints served by the ‚ÄúWar Plans‚Äù accoutremont for a specified tile, providing them as dummy moves. While War Plans requires selecting a tile, False Flags work across all tiles as a passive effect to counter War Plans for the phase in which the former is activated10. This muddles the information war between players.\n\nGovernment Insiders:\n\nResearching down this path and purchasing the associated accoutrement allows you to get estimates of other players incomes and AP.\n\nHi-Fi Audio:\n\nResearching down this path allows you to see more details about voice-chat rooms such as:\n\nThe total number of rooms are a given time;\nThe players currently in any call.\n\nNo level of research will show exactly which player is in which call, but by knowing the details above and using some deduction it should be possible to decipher who is with who in what calls."

These buffs center around reductions to the income cost of replenishment, some income bonuses for taking centers, and increases to the amount of AP earned for larger players. All accoutrements must first be researched for a fixed cost of income. After being researched, individual accoutrements must be bought with income (no AP needed for their use!). Accoutrements are tools for subterfuge and deceit. In the case of buffs, research functionally just means paying more for a better effect as the research for buffs is reset each turn. For accoutrements, research is a one-time cost‚Äîthe research is not reset‚Äîbut accoutrements are one-time use, and must be bought for each use.

    "text": "Terminology\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôve read through the main tutorial then you can skip this, but here‚Äôs a quick, non-exhaustive, note on terminology related to the game map:\n\nTiles\n\nThe core foundation of the map. These are the chunks of land that players move their armies on and fight directly over. Tiles which border seas are considered ‚ÄúCoastal.‚Äù You can build buildings and‚Äîif the tile contains a center‚Äîunits, on them\n\nSeas\n\nLike tiles, players move their navies on and fight over these. Notably, seas differ in that they do no contain centers, nor do they constitute provinces or regions, nor even can anything be built on them (you can‚Äôt build a building or units in a sea, you can only move in navies). These are pure battlegrounds. If a tile is entirely surrounded by a sea (think of a small island), that tile is considered to ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to the sea, meaning that the pair of areas is considered to act as a single area.\n\ne.g., a navy controlling the sea also controls the island, nothing can be put on the island. This is to avoid some seas with small islands becoming near-impenetrable as players could otherwise stack units in each island to defend the navy.\n\n\nCenters\n\nExclusively present on some tiles, these are represented by small circles on tiles where they are present. They earn income and action points for the players who control them, and allow players to build units if the player can support them.\n\nProvinces\n\nConstituted by a group tiles, and owned by a player if that player controls all centers within the province.\n\ne.g., if a province is made up of 5 tiles, and 3 of those tiles have centers, then you must control at least the 3 tiles with centers to control the province). These earn bonuses to income and action points for players who control them.\n\n\nRegions\n\nConstituted by a group of provinces, and owned by a player if that player controls all provinces within the region.\n\nBuildings\n\nCan only be built on tiles. There are two buildings:\n\nForts: Add +1 defense to the tile where they are built;\nSupply Hubs: Allow units adjacent to the supply hub to move two tiles in one move order (typically they can only move one) where possible:\n\ne.g., if there is an empty tile (or sea!) in front of a unit, and that unit is adjacent to a supply hub (either in the same tile or one next to the unit), then that unit can move through that empty tile and execute an order in the next ones adjacent to the empty tile. This only works if the intermediate tile in the order is empty! You cannot phase through an enemy to attack behind their lines.\n\nand allow for units to be built as if the tile was a center.",

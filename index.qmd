A game inspired by [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game) "Diplomacy (game) Wikipedia") but with its own identity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overview

Chicanery is a multiplayer strategy game with simultaneous turns following the turn/phase format of Diplomacy and using traditional Diplomacy unit combat mechanics. For a thorough understanding of that game, see the online multiplayer implementation linked here: [webDiplomacy](https://webdiplomacy.net/intro.php "Intro to webDiplomacy"). Chicanery notably diverges from Diplomacy in several aspects---see the [wiki](wiki.qmd "Chicanery game wiki.") for more---but aims to maintain the same core theme: emergent player interactions via negotiation (backstabbing your friends and starting fist-fights over a tabletop game from the '50s). Your fundamental objective remains to dominate the map by outwitting your friends.

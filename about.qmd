This is just a little attribution page for the game. Chicanery was made by [Tin Skoric](https://tins.page/ "Tin's page"), alongside design input from Kenny Luong. Of course the inspiration for the project is classic [Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game) "Diplomacy (game) Wikipedia") by [Allan B. Calhamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_B._Calhamer "Allan B. Calhamer wikipedia article."). Below are some links to us:
